This is a dotnet fork of the APMMHXSaveEditor (so credit to ezapm). Yes, it runs on Mac (and probably Linux).

Really I'm only concerned with charm editing for speed running purposes. This fork only does command line interaction and listing charms.
Soon it'll incorporate command line charm creation or editing. Unfortunately, adding and modifying things like armor and weapons is beyond my use cases for now.

If someone wants these features, please let me know. As far as GUIs go, there's a possibility of making this into a web platform service, but that's not planned at this time.
